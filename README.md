# Visualizing_Neural_Networks
Often while working with Artificial Neural Networks or other variations like Convolution Neural Networks or Recurrent Neural Networks, we want to visualize and create a diagrammatic representation of our compiled model,hence a method for people to visualize and understand their neural networks

Often while working with Artificial Neural Networks or other variations like Convolution Neural Networks or Recurrent Neural Networks, we want to visualize and create a diagrammatic representation of our compiled model. This can solve two purposes:

While defining and training multiple models allows us to visualize the depth of our model and compare different layers and how they are sequentially laid down.
Allows better understanding of the model structure, activation functions used in each layer, shape of each layer (number of neurons), and parameters that need to be trained
There are a few packages readily available in python that can create a visual representation of our Neural Network Models. The first three packages can be used even before a model is trained (the model needs to be defined and compiled only); however, Tensor Boards requires the user to train the model on accurate data before the architecture can be visualized.
